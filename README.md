This paper introduces a new method for training decision trees and random forests using CKKS homomorphic encryption (HE) in cloud environments,  enhancing data privacy from multiple sources.  
The innovative Homomorphic Binary Decision Tree (HBDT) method utilizes a modified Gini Impurity index (MGI) for node splitting in encrypted data scenarios. Notably, the proposed training approach operates in a single cloud security domain without the need for decryption, addressing key challenges in privacy-preserving machine learning.

# Code
The code utilizing HEaaN for GPU acceleration cannot be disclosed.   
Therefore, I will upload a part of the code utilizing pi-heaan, which can be shared.
